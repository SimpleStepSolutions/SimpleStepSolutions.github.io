Simple Step Solutions was established in 2014 as independent software contracting business. As we've worked with organizations from large to small across diverse sectors including
* <i class="fa fa-medkit"></i> healthcare, 
* <i class="fa fa-money"></i> finance, 
* <i class="fa fa-shield"></i> &nbsp;insurance, and
* <i class="fa fa-group"></i> not-for-profit

we've learned that there's so much more to helping businesses succeed with their technology than writing quality software -- as important as that is! Quality itself is no longer good enough. 

Simple Step Solutions is a software engineering, architecture, and culture consulting company -- **helping organizations find business value quickly through simple, agile, cloud-native, open-source solutions**. Simple Step delivers working software quickly so you can get the feedback you need to plan your next move.
