We're unbelievably honoured to speak this October at SpringOne Platform 2019 with a legend--Joe Grandja from Pivotal and also from Toronto, Canada.

> [Implementing Microservices Security Patterns and Protocols with Spring Security](https://springoneplatform.io/2019/sessions/implementing-microservices-security-patterns-protocols-with-spring-security)

We had the opportunity to contribute to the upcoming Spring Security 5.2 release by adding support for [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/) -- a security best-practice approach for securing not only public OAuth2 clients but now also confidential ones as well. We'll be demonstrating the support added for public client PKCE.
