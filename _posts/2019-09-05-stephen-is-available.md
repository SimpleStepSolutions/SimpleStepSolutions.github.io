If you're here because you are anticipating or have seen Stephen's talk with Joe Grandja at SpringOne Platform, Stephen is available to hire!

Through Simple Step Solutions, he's helped several organizations select an Identity Provider (e.g. Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, MitreID Connect, etc.) and launch applications that use it for authentication and authorization. He can help your organization with IAM-based architectures--especially with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
