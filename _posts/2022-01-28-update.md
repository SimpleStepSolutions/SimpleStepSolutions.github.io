It's been a while since I've published an update so figured I'd share a quick one. 

In February 2020, I began helping AXA XL by leading the design and development of an accelerator framework built on Spring Boot that leverages modern authentication/authorization. It's become the technology of choice for new application development or replatforming in the organization. I've also been the go-to person for charting the technical details of their external authorization strategy with Auth0 and Azure AD. It's been fascinating!

I've also been able to advise some other organizations in their identity and access management strategies on the side.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to speak at Devoxx France in April of 2020 due to COVID-19 but you can catch some of the [content](https://sdoxsee.github.io/blog/2020/01/06/stop-overloading-jwts-with-permission-claims) on my [technical blog](http://sdoxsee.github.io/).

Cheers,
Stephen
